The first thing to do before we can get going is populate the data model. To do this head over to the Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474/browser/ and type `:play movies`:

This will bring up a preview of the https://neo4j.com/developer/example-project/#_domain_model[domain model] that represents the movies database represented by a series of https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher] statements `CREATE` statements.

Cypher is the query language used by Neo4j. The following statement for example creates two new Neo4j nodes in the graph (one that represents a `Movie` and another that represents a `Person`):

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (TheMatrix:Movie {title:'The Matrix', released:1999, tagline:'Welcome to the Real World'})
CREATE (Keanu:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves', born:1964})
----

The value of the left side of the expression `TheMatrix:Movie` is the name of the node, like a variable name and is not stored in the database.

The value of the right side is the `Node` label (in this case `Movie`).

The values within the curly brackets are the node attributes.

The names of the nodes can be used in later statements to create relationships between the nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (Keanu)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Neo']}]->(TheMatrix)
----

The above `CREATE` statement creates a relationship between the `Keanu` node and the `TheMatrix` node. The relationship type is `ACTED_IN` and like nodes relationships can have attributes (in this case a `roles` attribute).

Click on the code to populate it into Neo4j browser editor:

This will place the necessary https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher] statements into the Neo4j browser editor that will populate the example database. You can then press the "Play" button to run the code and in the window below will appear a Graph visualization of the database model:
