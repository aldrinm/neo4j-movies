As mentioned previously, the REST endpoints to be implemented are:

* single movie listing by title
* movie search by title
* graph visualization of the domain

To implement these various REST endpoints first create a controller called `MovieController`. You can do so with the `grails` CLI or via your favourite text editor or IDE by creating a class within the `grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies` directory whose name ends with `Controller`:


[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-controller neo4j.movies.MovieController
----

The initial contents of the controller should look like the following:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/MovieController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/MovieController.groovy[tags=controller]
   ...
}
----

To map the various endpoints to the controller add the following to the `grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy` file:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy[tags=endpoints]
----

<1> Maps the `/movie/{title}` URI to an action called `show` of `MovieController`
<2> Maps the `/search` URI to an action called `search` of `MovieController`
<3> Maps the `/graph` URI to an action called `graph` of `MovieController`

Of course, none of these controller actions are implemented yet. Let's start with the first requirement.
