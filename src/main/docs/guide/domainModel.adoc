Now that you have configured GORM correctly, the next step is to define a domain model that maps the Neo4j graph.

To do so we are going to create domain classes to represent the two types of nodes in the domain model. You can use the `create-domain-class` command of the CLI to do this, or your favourite IDE or text editor:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-domain-class neo4j.movies.Person
$ grails create-domain-class neo4j.movies.Movie
----

In addition, we will create a domain class to model the _relationship_ between the two domain classes called `CastMember`:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-domain-class neo4j.movies.CastMember
----

Now open up the `Person` domain class located at `grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Person.groovy` and modify the contents to look like the following:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Person.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Person.groovy[]
----

As you can see a `Person` has a `name`, a year of birth and an association to `CastMember` (more on that later).

Now open up the `Movie` domain class located at `grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Movie.groovy` and modify the contents to look like the following:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Movie.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/Movie.groovy[]
----

A `Movie` has a `title`, a `tagline`, release `year` and also features an association to `CastMember`.

The `CastMember` domain class is going to model the relationship between a `Person` and a `Movie`. To do that we are going to use the `grails.neo4j.Relationship` trait, which allows us to map a domain class to a Neo4j relationship instead of a node:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/CastMember.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/neo4j/movies/CastMember.groovy[]
----

<1> The `Relationship` trait takes 2 generic arguments. The `from` entity and the `to` entity.
<2> Relationship entities can have attributes too, in this case a `roles` attribute
<3> We set the default relationship type to `ACTED_IN`
<4> The relationship types are represented by a `RoleType` enum
