The final piece of the puzzle is to include the official Neo4j example application UI which is a simple HTML page.

The `index.html` page can be found in the `complete/src/main/webapp` directory of this tutorial, simply copy it into your application's `src/main/webapp` directory and add the following definition to the `grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy` file:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/UrlMappings.groovy[tags=index]
----

This will ensure the root of the application is mapped to the `index.html` file. With that done you are ready to run the application!
