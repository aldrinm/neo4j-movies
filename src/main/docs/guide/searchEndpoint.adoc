The search endpoint allows clients to search for movies by title, without knowing the exact title. To implement the persistence logic add a new method to `MovieService` that implements the search logic:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/neo4j/movies/MovieService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/neo4j/movies/MovieService.groovy[tags=search, indent=0]
----

<1> The `search` method takes a query parameter and a `limit` parameter for maximum results
<2> A http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#whereQueries[Where Query] is used in combination with a regular expression to search by title
<3> If no query is specified an empty list is returned

TIP: This example also demonstrates an important concept with GORM Data Services, in that you can mix `abstract` methods that are implemented automatically by GORM with custom logic.

Now let's implement the controller action that will invoke this method:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/MovieController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/neo4j/movies/MovieController.groovy[tags=search, indent=0]
----

Finally, the `search` endpoint returns the result in a different JSON format to the `show` endpoint. So we create a `grails-app/views/movie/search.gson` view to format the JSON result:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/movie/search.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/movie/search.gson[]
----

If you now go to the http://localhost:8080/search?q=Matrix URL the resulting JSON will look like:

[source,json]
----
